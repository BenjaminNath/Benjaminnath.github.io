The Jessie Games is a site I developed with Wordpress for the organization. I also do volunteer work with them. Feel free to checkout the website and make a donation!

Text 'Em is an app I developed last summer. It's a text messaging service that allows you to send and recieve messages. Built with Java and Android Studio. The source code is hosted <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminNath/Text-Em">here</a> on Github.</p>

I wanted to get an understanding for Angular.js so I decided to make this Pomodoro clock using the framework. Use it to time yourself for a certain lenfth before being able to take a break. The code is hosted <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminNath/pomodoro-Clock">here</a> on Github.</p>

On my way to become a full stack developer, I decided to make a URL shortener and a Unix/human timestamp. Both accept arguments and will output either a shortened URL that will redirect to the original, or will give you the time as a natural or Unix timestamp. The URL shortener code is hosted <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminNath/url-shortener">here</a> on Github and the Timestamp code is <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminNath/Timestamp">here</a>. Both are made with a MEAN stack implementation.
